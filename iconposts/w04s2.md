In week 4 session 2, the homework task was to identify an icon that I thought was particularly effective at communicating my idea, to then proceed making another 20 altenrative thumbnail sketches for this specific icon. The icon I decided to focus on was 'weights'. I chose the icon 'weights' as I believe that it communicates the overall topic of my idea. My 20 thumbnail sketches are linked below:

Out of the 20 alternative thumbnail sketches, the skethc that resignated with me the most was "squat". the reason for this is that I am trying to target an audience that is needing guidance. By having a squatting icon, it shows an example of the correct form for the viewer, and how to perform the exercise properly, as well as the amount of reps per set. 

In addition to this, the second homework task was to create 45 icon concepts for our assessment two piece. These icons were also meant to be drafts of what we want our final product to potentially look like. The theme I have chosen for my assessment 2 piece is movement. As someone who is regulary active and has a passion for exercise, I thought that this topic was best suited to me and I could make it creative in my own aspects. Drawing off of the theme movement, I wanted to pitch the idea of making my target audience people who aren't confident with how to play certain sports, or aren't sure on how to do specific exercises, and the "website" allows you to follow basic instructions on how to complete the certain movement. The nine movements I have decided to include into my work are yoga, running, weights,swimming, dancing, soccer, tennis, basketball, and volleyball. 

The first 5 thumbnails illustrate the icon yoga. From the designs that I created, the sketch that is my personal favourite is called "meditation." This is because whilst meditation isn't a physical exercise, it teaches you hopw to concentrate on your breathing, as well as inhaling and exhaling patterns, which are critical when it comes to high intensity exercise. The icon is focused in the centre of the screen, and at street eye level. The lines of the icon are mainly horizontal, which is shown through the angle of the arms, and legs being crossed. This represents stability. Whilst the line shapes are angluar, which can create a focus on energy, I believe that the energy of the lines is a strong sense of calmness and focus. The line quality is mechanical, showing a sense of precision, however there is no line variation as all the lines join up and are all the same. The shape of the icon is geometric. No colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All five thumbnail sketches for yoga are shown below.

The second 5 thumbnails were an example of the movement running. My personal favourite of the 5 was the "running shoe". My reasoning for this is because it shows in detail the motion of how the foot in meant to be placed when running. Whilst for lots it might be self explanatory, when I very first began running, I was runnning incorrectly going from toe to heel which led to me becoming injured. So its important to focus on the minor details of an exercise as well. The icon is in the centre of the screen, and is in between streel level and worms eye level. The lines of the icon are diagonal, which is illustrated through the positioning of the icons foot, which shows energy as well as giving a sense of it being unpredictable. The line shape is curvy and wavy, and the line quality is mechanical. The shape of the icon is geometric and no colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for running are shown below.

The third 5 thumbnails focus on the idea of weights, which was the icon I focused on for the thumnail sketching activity. As said previously above, which I will repeat here, the sketch that resignated with me the most was "squat". the reason for this is that I am trying to target an audience that is needing guidance. By having a squatting icon, it shows an example of the correct form for the viewer, and how to perform the exercise properly, as well as the amount of reps per set. The icon is in the centre of the screen at street level. Thr lines of the icon are horizontal and showing stabilization thorugh the posititoning of the squat and the placement of the bar. The line shape is straight, which draws focus to the viewers eye, and the line quality is mechanical. The shape of the  icon is geometric and no colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for weights are shown below.

The fourth 5 thumbnail sketches that were drawn were an illustration of the movement "swimming". Out of the 5, the sketch called freestyle was my favourite. This is because it shows the movement of how to properly perform freestyle, with the angle of the elbow being the focus, and the positioning of the head when breathing whilst sweimming. The icon is in the cnetre of the screen at street level. The lines of the icon are horizontal, which is a representation of flow through water. The lines are curvy and wavy which was tpyically be an example of calmess, however the more waves that are shown, the more it becomes aggresive, as if its a freestyle race. The line quality is humanistic, which creates a sense of character, and the shape of the icon is geometric. No colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for swimming are shown below.

The fifth thumbnail that I created five skethes for was dancing. My favourite icon of the five that were made is called "improvisation". Not only was this my favourite sketch of the theme dancing, but was my favourite icon I had created out of the 45. THisi s because I believe it is my most creative, and shows how to perform a beginner dance step. I have been a dancer my entire life, so creating an icon for this movement was super exciting. The icon is in the centre of the screen, at street level. The lines of the icon are vertical, which shows power and attention, two things that are seen when performing as a dancer. The line ares in a wavy and zig zag formation, and the line quality is humanistic, which brings warmth. The shape of the  icon is geometric and no colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for dancing are shown below.

The sixth icon of movement that was deisgined was tennis. From the 5 icons that were created for this movement, the one that I believed linked back to my main idea concept was "single serve". It shows how to correctly hit a tennis ball, and the allignment of the body and arm whebn focusing on that specific movement. The icon is in the centre of the screen and at street level. The lines of the icon are vertical, which gives a poweful and aggresive energy to the movement. The lines are straight which draws attention to the exact allignment of how to correctly hit the ball. The line quality is mechanical which means to show auothority and precision, and there is no line variation. The shape of the  icon is geometric and no colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for tennis are shown below.

The seventh 5 thumbnail sketches that were drawn focused on the movement basketball. My favourite of the 5 that were created was called "basketball court". This is because it wasn't too difficult to design, and in addition shows the viewer the 'rules' of the basketball court, depending on your posititon when playing. The icon is in the centre of the screen and is show from a birds eye view. The lines of the icon are horizontal and the shape of the lines are straight. The line quality is mechancial, which makes it easy for hte viewer to comprehend how to play. The shape of the  icon is geometric and no colour has been included into this part of the draft stage yet. All 5 thumbnail sketches for basketball are shown below.
