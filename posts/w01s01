In Week 1 session 1, the class was assigned into groups to then go complete a scavenger hunt around the RMIT campus. I was in a team with Stella and Kevin. Whilst none of us knew each other, we all went into the scavenger hunt with an optimistic attitude and began the journey by slowing completing each clue given to us. Originally, our plan was to follow each task in order however, we came to the aggreement that it was best for us to achieve each task as we see them, rather than chronologically. The first task we completed was

We were given slight reassurance when there were two other teams already in the library, taking their selfie as evidence that they completed the first quest. We then followed both of the other teams actions, and took a picture which is linked above. Afterwards, we continued to walk through the library, admiring the space and interior. As we are walking through each room, we stumble across

At first, Stella, Kevin, and I were uncertain if it was illustrating the the task we were meant to be finding, but we trusted our intruition. The abnormal structure of the how the ceiling was designed, led us to believe it was the correct answer. As our team is about to exit the library, Kevin points out

We instantly knew that this was the answer to the clue we had been given. The feeling of excitement that was seen amongest me, Stella, and Kevin was astounding; as if all of us were starting to gain a stronger sense of hope that there was a potentinal chance of completing the entire scavenger hunt. We hustle out of the library, and as a team decide to recollect our thoughts and opinions on where we should aim to head to next. We collectively agreed that because we had skipped the first task, it was best to backtrack our footsteps and try and complete the first piece of the scavenger hunt. We pick up the pace and go seeking for all the cafes on campus. This leads us to finding a cafe that was on the other side of the RMIT campus. The name of this cafe was called little bang espresso. My brain instantly gathered the pieces together where I yelled out
