In Week 1 session 1, the class was assigned into groups to then go complete a scavenger hunt around the RMIT campus. I was in a team with Stella and Kevin. Whilst none of us knew each other, we all went into the scavenger hunt with an optimistic attitude and began the journey by slowly completing each clue given to us. Originally, our plan was to follow each task in order however, we came to the aggreement that it was best for us to achieve each task as we see them, rather than chronologically. The first task we completed was A book containing digital media wisdom, found amongst many.

We were given slight reassurance when there were two other teams already in the library, taking their selfie as evidence that they completed the first quest. We then followed both of the other teams actions, and took a picture, which is linked above. Afterwards, we continued to walk through the library, admiring the space and interior. As we are walking through each room, we stumble across A study space fit for a sith lord.

At first, Stella, Kevin, and I were uncertain if it was illustrating the task we were meant to be finding, but we trusted our intruition. The abnormal structure of the how the ceiling was designed, led us to believe it was the correct answer. As our team is about to exit the library, Kevin points out A wide next strung above, bulging under the weight of its flying paper cargo.

We instantly knew that this was the answer to the clue we had been given. The look of excitement that was seen amongest me, Stella, and Kevin was astounding; as if all of us were starting to gain a stronger sense of hope that there was a potentinal chance of completing the entire scavenger hunt. We hustle out of the library, and as a team decide to recollect our thoughts and opinions on where we should aim to head to next. We collectively agreed that because we had skipped the first task, it was best to backtrack our footsteps and try and complete the first piece of the scavenger hunt. We pick up the pace and go seeking for all the cafes on campus. This leads us to finding a cafe that was on the other side of the RMIT campus. The name of this cafe was called 'Little bang espresso'. My brain instantly gathered the pieces together where I yelled out An explosive cup of coffee.

In this given moment, it felt that all team members were contributing to accomplishing the scavenger hunt, regardless of what the actual outcome was going to be. I felt the adrenaline rush through my body when I had found the answer to this missing clue; we were one step closer to the finish line. After finding the fourth clue, the team looked at the tasks that were left. Kevin realised that he knew exactly where two of the next tasks were. We ran through the halls ands buildings of RMIT, which led us to outside where The disembodied hands of a great ape.

was. Whilst all of us were content with how our progress was coming along, we realised we were extremely short for time. There was only 15 minutes left until we needed to be back at class with our results for Thomas. Without questioning where we were next going, Kevin told me and Stella to follow his lead, which brought us to A door for the condemned.

This task in particular was a bit more challenging, considering there were a few doors that looked identical. The one thing that made this door more convincing was that I noticed there was a sign next to the door using the word "condemned". The team realised that it was better to have any answer than no answer. Our brains all started to slow down as we had all exhausted so much energy. We gradually walked back to the main building trying to all think about where the last four clues could be. As hope is starting to fade, another group approaches us asking how we are travelling with the scavenger hunt. When we tell them that we are struggling, they put their competetiveness to the side, and ask what we need guidance with. Our team explained that we were having serious troubles finding A basement-dwelling black box, bigger than you might think.

As well as A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land.

Without hesitation, the other team told us exactly where to go with detail, and Stella, Kevin, and I showed our gratitude emmensely. We sprinted downstairs, to the very bottom floor, and completed the 7th task which is attached two links above. Time was ticking away, with only ten minutes left on the clock, so despite the amount of stairs we had to run back up, there wasn't a singular complain from any team member and we moved with speed to the final clue we had time for, which is the link above. The only dilemma that arose with the vending machine, was that there was maintenance occuring, so below we attached an image to show evidence as to why A wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land may have looked slightly different.

Although we were unable to finish all ten tasks of the scavenger hunt, Keivn, Stella, and I were all so proud with the results we had ended up achieiving. Accepting the work that we had done, we briskfully walked back to our digital media studio one class, just in time for the class to begin again.
