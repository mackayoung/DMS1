In week 3 session one, the homework task was to upload our current drafted video for our assessment 1 self portrait. The process for me was an absolute disaster. This was due to the fact that everytime I went to post the video, the quality of the videos got worse, making the editing, lighting, and overall asessment look terrible. I watched a multitued of tutorials and articles on how to potentially resolve this issue, and whilst it isn't the most perfect quality, I believe that the final video I ended up uploading looks pretty much similar to the original video from in premiere pro. In temrs of the drafted video itself, I am content with the work that has been progressed, and the part with the black screen that hasn't been complete is being filmed tomorrow. Below is the link to the assessment 1 draft video.
