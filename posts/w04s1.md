In week 4 session 1, the homework task given was to create symbols only using four black squares, that represented the feeling or idea that was described underneath each blank box. Whilst completing this task, the class also learnt how to use Illustrator, which is the app that is being used to design our assessment 2 piece. The first idea that needed to be illustrated was order.

This theme was the easiest to achieve as when I thought of the word "order", I thought of symbols or shapes that also consisted with a rthym or where all squares shared the same dynamic, meaning all four squares were facing the same direction, and were all the same size. The word order also means the arrangement of things in relation to each other according to a particular sequence, pattern, or method. Because of this, the creativity wasn't as in depth compared to the other themes. The main box I chose for "order" was number 1.

I decided to choose this picture as my prime example of the theme order as whilst the sequence is simplistic, with all four squares creating one singular square shape in the middle, I thought that in this case simplicity would execute the idea of order the best. Showing all the squares match up perfectly both horizontly and vertically, as well as the overall square fitting perfectly in the centre of the white box. 

The next idea that was given to us was "increase". This theme was not too different to the theme order, where the conceptual idea of what to create wasn't too difficult as the idea was already addressed in the name. All my ideeas stemmed from showing the boxs gradually increase in size from small to large.

The main box I decided to pick was number 1

The reason for this being my finalised decision for the idea increase, was because not only did it show the squares increase in size, but I thought it represented a sort of ancient hierachy, with there being a larger proportion of lower class at the bottom (which is presented in the biggest box) and there being only so few upper class population at the top (which is seen in the smallest box). 

Following on from this concept, was the nest theme given to us which was "bold". My eight conceptual ideas are captured below. 

![A screenshot of the eight conceptual ideas for the theme "bold"](/w04s1/category_bold_.png)

The reason for me choosing to illustrate these ideas was because when I thought of the word "bold", it takes my mind to other words such as "big" and "extravagant". In saying this, most of my pieces focused on the four black squares being large and filling up the space of the blank box. Or alternatively, having the black sqaures be smaller so the white blank box becomes the centre of attention. 

I ended up choosing box number 4 to show the meaning of "bold". 

![box number 4 for bold](/w04s1/bold_box_number4_.png)

Box number 4 stood out to me as I thought it grasped onto a few different aspects of bold. Whilst half of the blank box was two large black sqaures filling the bottom left corner, and the upper right corner, the other corners of the original blank box are white with a tiny square in the upper left corner, and bottom right corner. This illustrates the theme bold, as it shows the major contrast in the light and dark colours, and how they can create an illusion of only parts of the blank box being there. 

The following theme was congested. I branched off of this idea by focusing on the difference between big shapes and small shapes. Furthermore, how big shapes can create a congesting feeling, vise versa small shapes feeling consumed in a larger space. These conceptual ideas are provided below.

For my main idea of congested, I stuck to the feeling of a big shape congesting what surrounds it, which was shown in box number 1.

The focus behind this was so that the large main black sqaure was meant to draw the viewers away from anything else, only for the audience to then realise that there are also three small squares going unnoticed in the bottom right corner. This demonstrates congested as it reflects on how the three other squares are invisible when the big square is blocking them and in the way. 

Moving on from this idea, the next theme was tension. This was my favourite theme to work on due to the ability to use creative design thinking, which allowed for the final conceptual ideas to be produced. I also enjoyed working on the theme tension, as I thought about how tension can be shown between four suqares, which people wouldn't normally think about. As you can see below, each box shows in its own way a passive aggresive energy.

I am a believer that the best ideas sometimes occur when you don't force them, which happened with my decided main box (number 6) for tension, seen in the next picture. 

![box number 6 for tension](/w04s1/tension_box_number6_.png)

This described tension as it shows a small square trying to fit through the gap to become 'whole' with the other three squares which have created a sort of 'maze'. This resembles tension as it is left undecided on whether the tiny square is actually going to be able to fit through the small gap left in the middle of the other squares, as well as this, it shows tension on how its the three big squares which have formed an alliance against the one tiny square which has been left on its own. 

The final theme that needed to be executed was "playful". I found this theme the most challenging as I struggled to resemble playfulness through squares. In addition, because I couldn't repeat any ideas from any of the other themes, I felt that all of my interesting ideas had already been used. However, whilst it did take me the longest, I was able to generate some conceptual ideas for the theme.

I took a more abstract approach to this idea, to show the playfullness that comes along when things aren't seen as so serious and constructed. The final box I chose to elaborate on this idea was box number five. 

![box number 5 for playful](/w04s1/playful_box_number6_.png)

I thought that this box best illustrated the idea "playful" As in a metorphorical way, I saw it as a family coming together as one, with "the smaller the box, the 'younger the child',". Adding onto this, being a child comes with the conceptual idea of life being playful, hence showing the playfulness that occurs when being a child and hanging out with your family.
