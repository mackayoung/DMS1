For assessment 3, the focus is to create a virtual world that resembles a significant change in your life. I have decided to focus on the change of me moving from Queensland to Melbourne, which will mainly represent the change in scenery from tropical and sunny, to city life and it being colder. However, instead of my virtual world showing QLD to VIC, it will show VIC to QLD, as since my move, I always go back to QLD every year for the summer which has been always a massive part of my life. 

The assets I am intending to use will depend on which virtual world the player is stepping foot in. When showing how my life was in Queensland, I want to show assets such as palm trees, sand, water, rocks. The noises that will be used are birds, wind, and waves. The assets I want to see when living in melbourne are rain, fog, lights, tall buildings. The noises that I aim to use are car engines or horns, rain hitting concrete, crowds. 

When moving from Queensland to melbourne, my family did a road trip. I have been doing road trips since I was 8 years old, and since our move we do a road trip to Queensland every summer. I want this to be shown in my journey by making the change between QLD and VIC show desserted mountains and trees. The colour palette will still be vibrant showings multiple hues of greens.
