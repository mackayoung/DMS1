VIDEO EDIT

How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
I wanted to create a sense of nostalgia over the short video. I felt like whilst the visual components were enlightening, the music that played in the background casted this feeling of sadness. Not because what was showing on the screen was sad, but more so to do with how looking back on events or significant moments of your life can really put you into perspective of how much you have changed, or how so much around you grown as well. I did a cover on the piano of Billie Eillishs song "what was I made for" which I think perfectly captured each clip that was shot. The echo's of real talking from my friends and family also created a nostalgic feeling as its as if the audience is able to relive in that exact moment. The actual scenes in my short video I wanted to entice the audience, so that it wasn't rushed and everything blended smoothly. Overall, captivating the audience through the sound of the music ad the videos that were on the screen.

How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?
I wanted to focus on the theme of love, which focused on me then incorporating different aspects of my life that showed how I interpret love. This then concluded to showing three sub categories of the theme love which were the beach, my friends, and family. I didn't want the footage to feel rushed, and I wanted each segment to really illustrate the beauty of all these aspects in my life. None of the footage was staged on purpose, and was captured in its raw element. This was create a feeling of the audience almost being able to step foot into the video so they are able to feel the love I have for these things and people as well. I made to choose some footage that was close up and personal so that the audience could feel in touch with what was being displayed, however I also then chose some further away visuals so that the audience could sink in the entire scene and keep its focus on the specific area. 

What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?
I wanted the sound of my video to enhance the clips that were already included in the final edit. I wanted to create a sense of nostalgia over the short video. I felt like whilst the visual components were enlightening, the music that played in the background casted this feeling of sadness. Not because what was showing on the screen was sad, but more so to do with how looking back on events or significant moments of your life can really put you into perspective of how much you have changed, or how so much around you grown as well. I did a cover on the piano of Billie Eillishs song "what was I made for" which I think perfectly captured each clip that was shot. The echo's of real talking from my friends and family also created a nostalgic feeling as its as if the audience is able to relive in that exact moment.

How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?  
After receiving constructive feedback, I realised that the pacing of each clip slightly varied and the video was lacking a sense of harmony. I decided to cut certain pieces of the video out, which elongated certain clips to create a more intense feeling where the viewer is able to sit and absorb the clips on the screen. The rhythm of the video matched with the dynamics and pace of the background music, so that the entirety of the video felt synchronised.  Pacing and rhythm helped to structure the timing of the project as I didn't want the video to feel rushed and energetic, I was trying to create a feeling of a safe place where someone can feel at peace, and therefore experience the feeling of how I think love feels. The pace of the music as well was extremely slow and elegant, which helped to capture the beauty in the video portrait. 

Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait? 
My portrait was a self reflection of the feeling and allurement of love. I incorporated the three main focuses of love into my video which were the beach, my friends and my family. All these aspects of love are extremely important in my life. All three segments were meant to feel like a video diary so the person watching is able to feel like they are living in the moment of the video as well. However, each segment came along with a more in depth meaning behind it. The beach plays a significant factor in my life, as I was raised in Queensland. From the age of four, my parents found a place in sunshine coast called Golden Beach and decided that this would be the annual place we visit every holiday. For as long as I can remember going to Golden Beach was something I would look forward to. A long quite strip of bay water, with the accommodation that looks over the entire bay where we watch the sunrises and sunsets, and in the night watch the ships glow in the night sky. We would walk onto the sand banks every morning which then was followed by the local bakery where we would eat Jam and cream donuts, then spend the whole day throwing ball on the beach, and coming inside around 4:30pm to watch Nickelodeon. Unfortunately, 2 years ago the weather broke the land barrier between the bay and ocean, and you can't swim nor lie on this specific part of Golden beach anymore. Whilst this event was so upsetting for our family, I look back and reminisce on having such a beautiful childhood memory, of such a beautiful place, and every beach or bay I go to now I think of Golden Beach and the love I had for it, and how it made me feel. The next segment of my video was my friends. My friends play a huge role in my life as they are the girls that I look forward to catching up with and spending my weekends with. I didn't realise how much I loved these girls until I left school and realised that I don't see them anywhere near as much anymore. I went from seeing them 5 times a week, to now if lucky once on the weekend. This change was a really difficult time in my life as I felt quite isolated and alone, but then I realised once I changed my mindset that these were girls I wanted to be in my everyday life and valued so much, and as a collective, all us girls started putting in a lot more energy and time so that we still felt like we all had each other. We now speak about our futures and everything we will do together as we grow up and it makes me realise the love I have for them all and I wouldn't change a thing. Lastly, my final segment was about my family. My Family is quite literally like living in a house full of best friends. I love my sisters and brother, and my parents. I would do absolutely anything for any one of them. The clip I captured in my video portrait was on my dads birthday. Birthdays have always been a very special and important day in our household. Every year for my birthday my dad fills up my room with balloons and I never get sick of it. The main moment I captured in my video was my sister Em bringing over the cake to my dad and his face lighting up with pure joy and love. This specific moment reminded me of my favourite photo of me and my dad from when I was little. My dad has always been my number 1 supporter and watching him be so happy on his birthday made me feel so beyond content. Experiencing this wad a different type of love, as I know how hard my dad works to make me and my siblings happy, so watching him feel that same feeling in return was all I could ever ask for.  


What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work? 
The aesthetic I chose was rich, romantic, surreal, uplifting, and emotional. These are a few key expressions of my self portrait. I decided to focus on these qualities as I felt they best described the feeling and meaning of the word love that I was trying to illustrate. Love is such an intense and powerful word which everyone interprets differently, so for that reason I wanted to touch on my view of how I perceive love in a positive way. This was shown through shooting shots 


GRAPHIC ICONS 

How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?
The idea behind my suite of icons centres on health, fitness, and well-being, reflecting my deep passion for these areas. I chose this theme because maintaining a healthy lifestyle is vital to my daily life and personal values. Each icon is designed to visually represent key aspects of health and fitness, such as exercise (the running shoe), nutrition (the banana icon), and other wellbeing aspects (heart rate tracker). By creating these icons, I aimed to inspire and motivate others to prioritize their well-being. The simplicity and clarity of the icons are meant to make them easily recognizable and universally understood.

Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with? 
There were several different approaches before finalizing my suite of icons. Initially, I focused on different fitness activities, but I quickly realized this approach was somewhat restrictive creatively. While I always knew my theme would remain within the health and fitness category, I found that expanding to include broader well-being icons offered more flexibility and scope for creativity. Ultimately, I chose this approach because it allowed me to explore various aspects of health and wellness that genuinely interest me. Additionally, I gained the most enjoyment from creating these icons, making the process both fulfilling and aligned with my passion for health and fitness.

How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained? 
Translating my thumbnail sketches into final flat designs in Illustrator was a smooth process due to their simplicity. The straightforwardness of my initial sketches meant that there were few complications during the design phase. I didn't encounter many issues with creating the graphic icons; the primary challenge arose during the final stage when uploading the icons to ensure they appeared consistently across different devices and platforms. This technical aspect required adjustments to maintain the integrity of the designs as I saw them on my computer. Overall, the translation process was efficient, maintaining the clarity and intent of my original sketches.

How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did? 
To create a sense of unity and visual interest in my icons, I used vibrant colours to immediately capture the viewer's attention. Colour was the primary focus of my assessment, and as a perfectionist, I ensured each hue complemented the others. I applied colour theory concepts learnt in class, including primary, secondary, complementary, and split complementary colours, to enhance my work. If I wasn't changing the colour, I adjusted the shades, such as pairing navy with a pale sky blue. This approach matched the energy of the simplistic icons, ironically enhancing their final look and creating a cohesive and visually engaging set of graphic icons. 

How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design? 
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the sound to work in my final uploaded piece due to complications with the uploading process from my computer. This was extremely disappointing as I had carefully selected audio clips that perfectly matched what each icon illustrated. For instance, the heart rate icon had a subtle heartbeat sound. Although the audio wasn't accessible from someone else's computer, I felt that the audio elements corresponded well with the visual elements, clearly indicating what each icon's sound would be. 


How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs? 
To translate the prompt from an abstract idea to concrete visual designs, I carefully followed each instruction, ensuring accuracy at every step. I watched YouTube tutorials to master each sequence correctly and referred to the rubric to understand the assessment criteria fully. Before creating the final digital versions, I hand-drew my icons to have a rough visual guide, which helped in maintaining a clear vision of my end goal. This initial step allowed me to experiment and refine my ideas on paper first. By combining careful planning, continuous learning, and detailed execution, I successfully turned abstract concepts into well-defined visual designs.


VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 

How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process? 
Having a working prototype was incredibly crucial in my design process. It ensured that I focused on creating something achievable rather than ending up with an unrealistic final result. Mapping out my prototype and visualizing how to depict a significant change in my life was essential. I was aiming for the player to clearly understand the shift from Melbourne to Queensland. Similar to Assessment 1, my goal was for  the player to feel immersed in my experience. The prototype helped me to map out the scaling of how large I wanted certain assets to be, whilst also drawing from colour theory in Assessment 2, I focused on different lighting and hues to enhance the intended mood.

How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media? 
Designing and producing a three-dimensional environment presented multiple challenges compared to working in two-dimensional media. The complexity increased due to the requirement to consider a larger spatial area in three dimensions, resulting in a broader scope of work that included a multitude of 3D objects. Navigating user interaction within the 3D space adds another layer of intricacy not found in 2D design. In contrast, designing in 2D felt more straightforward as it involved a simpler process without the added depth and perspective considerations. The transition from 2D to 3D design required me to shift my mindset to effectively tackle the increased complexity.

What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?
In Assignment 3, the virtual camera's role was to lead the viewers through a life-changing event, showcasing a significant transformation. This differed from my assignment 1 where the camera's purpose was open to individual interpretation regarding self-representation. The difference is evident in Assignment 3, which focuses on illustrating a significant transition from one stage to another, in contrast to Assignment 1's broader theme of personal expression. Both assignments captured diverse facets of personal experiences, highlighting unique aspects of the creator's life journey without direct similarities between the two narratives.

How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2? 
Unfortunately I wasn't able to complete the sound for assessment 3. Due to multiple external commitments and unforeseen circumstances during this semester, it resulted in me gradually falling behind. While I couldn't complete the sound aspect for this assessment, my original idea to capture a dark city night, hearing the light rain and wind howling through the streets. The wind from this scene would have transitioned gradually to a serene tropical beach setting, where palm trees sway in the gentle breeze and distant waves crash against the shore.

How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development? 
My approach to unifying the elements in my virtual environment centred around contrasting my experiences living in Melbourne and Queensland. Initially, I planned for the game to start in Queensland and transition to Melbourne. However, I shifted the concept to begin in Melbourne to highlight the enduring connection to Queensland, a place that holds significance for me despite no longer living there. This idea emphasized how returning to Queensland annually bring up memories of my childhood and reinforces its special place in my heart. While I couldn't finish the beach part of the virtual environment, it was an crucial part of my intended narrative.

What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise? 
The process of playtesting revealed to me the detailed and precise nature of every aspect required for the game to flow smoothly, which I may not have realized otherwise. Despite finding such specifics challenging to grasp initially, I encountered various obstacles related to the rendering of my game, as well as ensuring a seamless flow without glitches was proved to be difficult. This experience highlighted the importance of investing time and effort into detailed work like game development, emphasizing the need for patience and practice instead of rushing through the process.


OTHER HOMEWORK QUESTIONS 

Begin to plan out the overall structure of your webpage, and consider how you will distribute this information across a timeline of the semester
I plan for my overall structure of my web page to be simple and neat. As someone who expresses themselves through creativity, seeing a page with no colour and  bunch of words isn't pleasing. Although I want to go into depth about each assessment, and write critically about everyone, I also want to make sure that its pleasant for the reader by adding in light bursts of colour, or adding images in certain places so that the layout is overall pleasant. I want to distribute the information into sections so it isn't completely clustered. Maybe having icons that automatically take you to the specific section you are wanting to read. I also will make sure my writing is slightly broken up, which allows for the reader to not feel so overwhelmed, and can rather absorb all the content I have shared. 

What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
I want the aesthetic of my webpage to be elegant, classy, stylish, and minimalistic. I am a firm believer of sometimes less is more. Lots of people struggle to process a multitude of things at once, so breaking up the webpage will help to focus on this aesthetic for the user. 

Who is the target audience?
My target audience is people who want to get into digital media but aren't sure if it’s the course for them. As someone who initially was sceptical bout choosing this course, I feel that I have completely grown and learnt so much and would love to be able to share that two sense with someone who currently might be feeling the way I did at the very beginning. 

What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
The features that might entice my reader is icons that take you straight to the writing you are wanting to read. This allows for quick access to information rather than having t scroll through multiple pieces of writing to get to what you are interested in. Other features might be a glimpse of the process of my assessments such as screenshots of my work.
